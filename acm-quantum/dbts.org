JR:
 - Chebyshev probability equation graph: shade only left support ?
 - Subgroup tiling the group. With what can we multiply for this?
   
RK:
 - Proof of polynomial mult with DFT
 - QFT derivation perhaps
 - Period finding problem with QFT
   + End up with many c_i/r from which we find r. How?
   + Continued fraction ??
 - HW suggested on 18th: Trying Gaussian elimination to appreciate lattice-based crypto

PG:
 - Z3 gave dunno. Can it always say UNSAT/SAT answer?

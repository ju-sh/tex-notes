* L1
** Grover search with multiple marked elements
 - t marked elems => (initial?) probability of getting marked elem = more
 - |U> = eq sp over unmarked elems
 - |M> = eq sp over marked elems

 - What would θ be now?
   + for 1 marked elem was 1/√N
     
\ket{\psi_E}  = 1/\sqrt{n}
* L2: Quantum deep hedging
 - Options and futures in stock trading
 - Put option: Gives buyer right to buy a share if it crosses a /strike price/
   + Call option: Strike price is higher than current price
   + Put option: Strike price is lower than current price
     * You have to pay some extra for this. A premium
     * DBT: Mandatory to buy. Not for options
     * You pay the premium upfront
 - Options: gives a right to buy not mandatory    
 - Futures: mandatory to buy
 - You can even sell the options you hold. If it crosses strike price, premium will go up
 - European options: There is a fixed time window
   + just a name. a flavour of options
   + not associated with only Europe
 - Asian options 
 - American options: not very popular
   
 - Adjust investments to minimise loss = hedging
 - Banks are forbidden to trade themselves
   + They are supposed to faciliate market
   + So they try to maintain 0 loss 0 profit. expectation-wise
   + There will still be some loss. covered by brockerage
   + Better model => lower brockerage rate
   + Different banks different models and different brokerage rate
   + Aim = get as close to reality as possible
     
 - Deep hedging
   + ∵ facilitated by deep NN ??
   + Reinforcement learning + hedging
 - Using this setup in a QC set-up = quantum deep hedging
   + To see if there can be some advantage
     
   
   
       
Misc:
 - RL jargon
   + policy search
   + actor-critic
 - quantum hardware is suited for dealing with P distributions
 - Companies: IBM, Quantiuum
 - DK
   + Determinent and permentant corresponding to fermions and boson
   + Boson encoding
   + 8GHz computer = heating like a nuclear power plant or even the sun => not viable.
   + End of Moore's law
   + Future of QC
     * Material science could catch up => realistic larger QC computers
     * Quantum error correction
 - DBT: why were options in stock market created
 - Geometric brownian motion
 - /Observables/ in quantum computing
 - DBT: simulator vs emulator
   + simulator: focus on software
   + emulator: focus on software and hardware
 - DBT: quantiunuum's own packages
 - Black Scholes: an algo in finance (already old school)
 - nisq quantum computer:
   + current era qunatum computers ??

Work being discussed 
 - FOSS with JP Morgan
 - 2 parts
   1) Classical env + QNN
   2) Quantum env + quantum ML
 - JAX python framework

ML is an empirical science.
Got to try to figure it out.

NOT not distinguishable
but hadamard application a specific reg gives different result in reg1, for fun also try reg2

we have been looking at pure quantum states
 - fix one reg value and look at other => mixed state via a density matrix
 - mix state upon partial measurement ??
 - density matrix
   + trace =1 
   + rank 2 = entangled
   + rank 1 = no entanglement ??
 - entropy of a pure state = 0 ??, that of mix state ≠ 0 ??
 - quantum computing is quite simple if you keep physics out of it.
 - start with 1 H compute H agian => -1 form of function
 - phase kickback
 - H => place function in amplitude/phase. now oracle can't see it, but apply H gate again it's back to state ??
